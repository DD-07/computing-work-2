# *computing-work*

Teachers are hardworking and patient
filled with determination and dedication  
always gracious and inspirational

They were sent to teach us 
and to help us to comprehend
and will continue till the end

Education the teachers start
Languages, Sciences, Humans and Art
we learn the knowledge that they depart
they will always stay in our heart 

You moulded each of us with pride
so all of us can decide
how to live our life
and how to abide by law's side

If we sidetrack
You never slack
only getting us back on the track
Though you may get heart attacks :)

You may have thought you were merely teaching
When you were helping to eliminate fear
soon from my life you shall disappear
but i will never forget your teachings that I hold dear

The letters on the piece of paper 
Shows your dedication and motivation
For us, Dunmanians

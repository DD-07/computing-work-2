*teachers day poem?*
guys pls gime ideas to make this better.

Teachers are hardworking and patient
filed with determination amd dedication  
always gracious and inspirational

They came to teach and was sent
to help us comprehend
till the dead end

The game of life 
teachers get it start
from the race to the depart

You moulded us with pride
so we can decide
how to live life
and how to abide by law's side

If we sidetrack
You never slack
only getting us back on the track
Though you may get heart attacks :)

You may have thought you were merely teaching
When you were helping to eliminate fear
Never leaving the door ajar
Into the biosphere

The letters on the piece of paper 
Shows your dedication and motivation
For us, Dunmanians

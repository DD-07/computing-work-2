# *computing-work*

Teachers are hardworking and patient
filled with determination and dedication  
always gracious and inspirational

They were sent to teach us and
to help us to comprehend
and will coninue till the end

Education the teachers start
we learn the knowledge that they depart

You moulded us with pride
so we can decide
how to live life
and how to abide by law's side

If we sidetrack
You never slack
only getting us back on the track
Though you may get heart attacks :)

You may have thought you were merely teaching
When you were helping to eliminate fear
soon from my life you shall disappear
but i will never forget your teachings that I hold dear

The letters on the piece of paper 
Shows your dedication and motivation
For us, Dunmanians
